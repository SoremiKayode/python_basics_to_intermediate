# There are threw ways to write name a variable that have multiple words in python, these three type are called
# camel case, pascal case, and snake case
# print("Soremi Kayode")
# camel_case = nameOfStudent
# pascal_case = NameOFStudent
# snake_case = name

# type and run this line of code :
nameOfStudent = "Abiola"
NameOFStudent = "Boluwatife"
name_of_student = "Eric"

print(nameOfStudent)
print(NameOFStudent)
print(name_of_student)



# computer is all about, taking input, process the input and give output, in python you take input using the input(), while you
# display output using the print() tag
# Note: 
# when you take input the data type it will return is a string, if you want to accept interger: that is number, you wil have to 
# convert into an interger using int(input())

# type and run this line of code
name_of_student = "Soremi"
surname_of_student = input()
age_of_student = input()
print("my name is", name_of_student)
print("my surname is", surname_of_student)
print("I am", age_of_student)

# Note : it will ask for your input in the terminal




# # rule 1: your variable name can only contain letters, numbers and undercore
# # rule 2: variable cannot start with a number
# # rule 3 there should not be space in the name of your variable
# # this variable contain name of student in basic one
# x = input()
# x2 = input()



# Data tyes in python:
# Numbers
#     intergers: intergers are number without deimal
#     float: float are numbers with decimals
#     complex: complex are numbers with imaginary part, and that imaginary figure is represented by j
# Letters
#     String: are letters and they must be in quotation mark

# Sequence Datatype
#     list
#     tuple
#     range
# Mapping Datatype
#     dictionary

# set datatype
#     set
#     frozenset

# Booleans
#     True
#     False

# bag_of_rice = 1000e5
# keg_of_oil = 50.22e10
# transport_fare = 30j
# print(transport_fare)

# x = 2, 5, 8
# # x = 4

# first_number = input()
# second_number = input()

# print(int(first_number) + int(second_number))
# ======================== NUMBER TYPE ===========================
#NUMBERS  : number can be an interger or a float

#type and run this line of code
age = 24 # this is an interger
height = 2.4 # this is a float 
mass = 2.6e7 #this is a float, the e is a scientific number

print(age)
print(height)
print(mass)


# ============================== LETTER TYPE ========================================
#STRINGS string are characters, the rue is they must be in a quotation mark, it can be double quotation, single quotation
# or mutiline string with three double or single quotation mark

#type out and run this line of code
my_name = 'Frank' #string with single quotation mark
my_favorite_subject = "Mathematics" # string with double quotation mark
poem = """
make hare while the sun shine,
time wait for no man
however the patient do eat the fatest bone
"""

poem_2 = '''
twine twinle little star,
how i wonde what you are,
up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky
'''
# the poem variable is a multiline tring it has three double quotation mark, it can be single quotation mark just like poem_2

print(my_name)
print(my_favorite_subject)
print(poem)
print(poem_2)


# ==================================== SEQUENCE TYPE ================================
# under sequence type we have list, tuple and range

# ---------------------- LIST ---------------------------------
# list are arrays or group of items, they are placed in a square bracket [], and each item is seperated by a comma,
#any data type can be in a list, interger, float, tring, complex and even a list
name_of_course_mate = ["frank", "Eric", "sam"] # list containing only intergers
